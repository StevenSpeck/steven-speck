        <h1>
          What Is Dyslexia
        </h1>
        <h2>by Steven Speck February 9, 2024</h2>

          <h3 id="thesis">After looking for functional resources on how to assist students with dyslexia I found that public guidance is severely lacking.  While youth dyslexia is an
            issue to be primarily considered in the classroom environment, leaving it solely to the classroom would deprive a student all of the wonderful reading opportunities
            outside of the classroom that are more and more often treated as the primary source of gaining literacy for kids.  Additionally, what researces should those in school specialists
            be referring parents.  As an educator who has dyslexic students, I would like to assemble all of the resources that I find relevant to the topic.

          <h4>Initial Sources (Wikipedia, Mayo Clinic):</h4>
          <p>        Most online research can and should start with Wikipedia, and that is where we will as well.  Wikipedia is far from being a definitive source of truth, but it is thoughtfully crafted
            which is far from being true for most sources online.  But it does help establish some common language around a disorder like Dyslexia, as well as providing some initial sources of research material.
            What Wikipedia always lacks is any executable information, for example, while running and weight lifting are simple activities to get into there is zero guidance on those Wikipedia pages
            allowing someone to build out even a session, week-long routine, or so help us a month-long routine.

            For something as complex as a learning disorder, we have to look elsewhere but there is immediate value here in term of historical, biological, and psychological information.
